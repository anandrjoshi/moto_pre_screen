4)	Write a program that determines if two strings contain the same characters
Solution:

I came up with two approaches to solve the problem.
a. using_Array(): This function checks if all the characters in both the strings are same. However,
it doesnot take care of number of repetitions. Meaning that if a character 'a' is present in both 
the strings it points out that both strings have character 'a'. It doesnot care how many number of times
'a' is reapeated in either string1 or string2. 

b. using_ascii_sum(): This function checks if ascii sum of all the characters in both the strings is same.
Here it takes care of number of times each character is repeated within a string and compares the same with 
the other string. 

So the output says whether both the strings have exact same character set or not. It also tells you whether 
each character is repeated exactly same number of times in both strings or not.
